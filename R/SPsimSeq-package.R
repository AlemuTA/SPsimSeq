#'
#' SPsimSeq uses a specially designed exponential family for density estimation 
#' to constructs the distribution of gene expression levels from a given real RNA 
#' sequencing data (single-cell or bulk), and subsequently, simulates a new 
#' dataset from the estimated marginal distributions using Gaussian-copulas to 
#' retain the dependence between genes. It allows simulation of multiple 
#' groups and batches with any required sample size and library size.
