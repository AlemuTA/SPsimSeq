#' SPsimSeq package
#'
#'
#' Using a specially designed exponential family for density estimation 
#' it constructs the distribution of gene expression from a given real RNA 
#' sequencing data (single and bulk). Subsequently, it simulates a new 
#' dataset from the estimated density. It allows simulation of multiple 
#' groups and batches with any required sample size and library size.
