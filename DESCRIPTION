Description: Using a specially designed exponential family for density estimation 
             it constructs the distribution of gene expression from a given real RNA 
             sequencing data (single and bulk). Subsequently, it simulates a new 
             dataset from the estimated density. It allows simulation of multiple 
             groups and batches with any required sample size and library size.
